I came from a Computer Engineering background with PhD in computer science PhD degree at QMUL  specializing in Computer Vision with a research focus on the development and optimization of Convolutional and  Transformer models to address intricate challenges in vision-based and LLM tasks, including high 3D detection in Autonomous Vehicles. I have experience in high-performance computing, particularly in optimizing algorithms using CUDA kernels, to achieve efficient and scalable solutions. My experience as a Technical Manager, Software Engineer, and Teaching Fellow has honed my abilities in team leadership, effective communication, and cross-functional collaboration. I am eager to apply these skills in a challenging environment to drive technological advancements and mentor emerging talents in the field of AI/Smart Navigation systems.

I am a continuous learner, always seeking to stay at the forefront of AI/ML advancements. My goal is to leverage cutting-edge technologies to drive business innovation, enhance user experiences, and make a positive impact on the world.

If you're looking to collaborate on innovative AI/ML projects or are interested in discussing the latest trends in the field, feel free to connect.
